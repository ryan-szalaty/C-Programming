# Harvard-CS50
This repository contains the assignments that are completed alongside Harvard's CS50 course.

The course structure looks like this:

Week 0 Scratch

Week 1 C

Week 2 Arrays

Week 3 Algorithms

Week 4 Memory

Week 5 Data Structures

Week 6 Python

Week 7 SQL

Week 8 HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Week 9 Flask

Week 10 Emoji

Each week includes a video lecture and problem sets to solve. I have included the problem sets that I worked because I needed to practice with new concepts. Therefore, the Scratch, HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Emoji sections are not included in this repository as I have worked with them before and feel comfortable.
