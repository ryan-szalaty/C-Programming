# Harvard-CS50
This repository contains the assignments that are completed alongside Harvard's CS50 course.

The entire course spans ten weeks. Each week includes a video lecture and problem sets to solve. I have included the problem sets 
that I worked because I needed to practice with new concepts. Therefore, the HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Emoji sections are not included
in this repository as I have worked with before and feel comfortable.

You can find the course and what it offers students by following this link: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/
